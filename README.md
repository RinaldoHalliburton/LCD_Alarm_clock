Alarm clock using LCD.
An alarm clock is a timekeeping device that is designed to emit a sound at a specific time to alert someone, to wake up, or to serve as a reminder for a particular event. Traditionally, alarm clocks were mechanical devices that used gears and springs to keep time and trigger the alarm. Today, many alarm clocks are digital and can offer a variety of features including time and date keeping. They are commonly used to help people wake up in the morning at a set time.
